# soc-analysis

This project is an updated version of an analysis I did on the Census's Survey of Construction dataset

Objective:

Our objective is to obtain an estimate of the predicted impact of not having enough capital to qualify for a conventional loan. FHA loans 
have lower capital requirements than conventional loans. And looking at the difference between the homes purchased by FHA homebuyers and 
conventional homebuyers we should be able to get some idea of how impactful it is to be lacking in initial capital. There are several 
challenges to ensuring the estimate is reliable. Some challenges can be overcome, others can perhaps be overlooked at least for this 
analysis.
